sponsor_coverage.py — dataeng-sponsor-coverage prototype

Domain: an international master's student in Data Analytics Engineering on F-1,
looking for data-engineering work that will need H-1B sponsorship.

The one hidden signal this makes visible: **the difference between a company
that has no H-1B record and a company that has a negative one.**

In data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-csv/mapped_student_employment_targets_v3.csv,
30,369 companies carry funding data but only 1,557 (5.1%) have a populated
`Total Approvals` cell. Of those, exactly FIVE record a zero — so the file holds
5 actual "no" answers and 28,812 silences. A tool that treats a blank cell as
"does not sponsor" manufactures 28,807 rejections nobody wrote down. So this script
emits THREE sponsorship states, never two:

    record-positive : approvals > 0            -> sponsorship p from the record
    record-negative : approvals == 0, denials>0 -> sponsorship p = 0.0
    no-record       : both blank               -> p is NOT emitted; coverage
                                                  reason is `no-sponsorship-record`

A `no-record` company is not a Skip and not an Apply. It is a *networking*
target: the 3-3-2 day's three networking hours, not its two applying hours.

Nothing here invents a value. Every emitted field carries a source label of
`record`, `model-judgment`, or `your-input`, per DATA_CONTRACT.md.

#
# Two things this pattern has to get right, both learned the hard way:
#
# 1. WORD BOUNDARIES. An earlier version used `a\.?i\.?` to catch "AI", which
#    matched the letters "ai" inside other words — "Supply Ch(ai)n Planner",
#    "Regulatory Aff(ai)rs", "Medical Science Li(ai)son" all scored as AI roles.
#    Every alternative below is anchored with \b.
#
# 2. "AI ENGINEER" DOES NOT APPEAR IN THIS DATASET — not once in 30,369 rows.
#    The work is filed as "Machine Learning Engineer" (48 rows). Of the 235
#    companies whose record matches any target title, 194 match WITHOUT
#    "Machine Learning Engineer" and 235 with it — so a student using their own
#    vocabulary misses 41 employers, 17.4%. That gap is the asymmetry this recipe
#    exists to surface, so the AI alternatives stay in the pattern as
#    documentation of a negative result, not because they match anything.
