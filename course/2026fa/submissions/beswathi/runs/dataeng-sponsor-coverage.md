# dataeng-sponsor-coverage — human report

**Recipe:** `beswathi-dataeng-sponsor-coverage` v0.1.0  
**Run date:** 2026-10-02  
**Input:** `data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-csv/mapped_student_employment_targets_v3.csv` (30369 rows read)

## What this run found

| Bucket | Count | Next action in the 3-3-2 day |
|---|---:|---|
| Apply candidates (sponsorship **on record**) | 8 | the 2 applying hours — after G3 liveness |
| Network targets (**no** sponsorship record, funded) | 26337 | the 3 networking hours |
| Skips (record-negative: denials only) | 0 | skip, with a reason |
| **Senior-only sponsors** | 101 | **not reachable at <1 yr experience** |

Skip is a success. A company in the middle bucket is **not** a non-sponsor —
it is a company with no record either way, which is a different event.

### The seniority wall

This student has under a year of experience. In the shipped file, of the
sponsored data/AI titles: **47.5% are senior-coded** (Senior / Staff / Lead /
Principal / II+), **52.1% are unmarked**, and **exactly one title in 30,369
companies is explicitly junior**. Companies filing H-1B essentially do not
file for juniors.

So 235 companies sponsor *some* data/AI title, but only ~136 sponsor one a new
grad could hold. The 101 companies above are recorded, not silently dropped:
they sponsor, but only at a level this student cannot apply to yet. For a
job search that is a different fact from "does not sponsor", and it is the
second-largest bucket on this page.

## Timeline gate (your-input)

- I-20 end: `2026-12-23`
- OPT start planned: `2027-01-05`
- Hiring lag assumed: **75 days** (assumption, not a measurement)
- Unemployment allowance: 90 days
- Gate factor: **1.0** (ok)

## Role-quality rows loaded (record)

- SOC rows: `15-1243.01, 15-2051.00`
- Problem: `none`

> Role quality carries **zero weight** in `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs`
> (`role_quality: 0.0`, tagged `[VERIFY]`). This recipe therefore reports the
> SOC wage/ability rows in this human report only, and does **not** feed them
> to the scorer. See DOMAIN.md → Known gaps, fact 1.

## Sponsorship base rate by funding stage (computed from this file)

| Stage | Sponsors / companies | Base rate |
|---|---:|---:|
| Pre-Seed | 137 / 9658 | **1.4%** |
| Seed | 188 / 6325 | **3.0%** |
| Series A | 329 / 6196 | **5.3%** |
| Series B | 364 / 3300 | **11.0%** |
| Series C | 265 / 1421 | **18.6%** |
| Series D+ | 249 / 974 | **25.6%** |

This is the one number this recipe adds. A company with **no** sponsorship
record is not a dead end and not a yes — but its funding stage carries a
base rate, and the spread is large enough to triage on.

**What it is not.** A base rate over this file is not a prediction about any
single company, and this file contains companies someone already chose to
map — so these rates describe the file, not the economy. Stages with fewer
than 100 companies get no rate rather than a noisy one.

## Where the reachable market is (record)

Counted from the shipped file: employers with a sponsored target title,
split by whether any of those titles sits at a level a new grad could hold.

| State | Sponsors (any level) | New-grad reachable | Share of reachable |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CA | 141 | **84** | 62.7% |
| NY | 49 | **24** | 17.9% |
| MA (home) | 22 | **15** | 11.2% |
| WA | 10 | **5** | 3.7% |
| TX | 8 | **4** | 3.0% |
| IL | 5 | **2** | 1.5% |

**Read this as geography, not as a gate.** This run does not filter on
location and does not score a role down for being far away: the candidate
is open to relocation inside the US and to remote work, so a distant role
is a real option rather than a dead end. Adding a location filter here
would be the scorer deciding something the human already decided.

What the table is for is sizing the cost of *choosing* to stay put.
CA + NY + WA hold 113 of 134 new-grad-reachable sponsors (84.3%).
MA holds 15 (11.2%), so restricting the search to MA would discard about 89% of the employers that can hire this profile at this level. That is a decision worth making deliberately rather than by default.

### MA shortlist (13, unverified — still behind G3)

The home-state employers this pass reached. They are listed because
they are cheap to pursue in person, not because they scored better:
none has cleared the liveness gate, and none is ranked above a
candidate elsewhere.

## Human gate

G3 (liveness) is **not cleared by this script**. Before any Apply,
a human runs `npm run ats:liveness -- <job-url>` and records the result.
This script emits `liveness.source: model-judgment` precisely so the
scorer's Apply cannot be mistaken for a verified live posting.
